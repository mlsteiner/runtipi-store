# nextExplorer

Self-hosted file access for teams, homelabs, and agencies with a refined interface.

## Quick Start
nextExplorer is a modern, self-hosted file explorer crafted for teams, creative agencies, and homelabs that demand both polish and control. It ships as a single Docker container, works perfectly with mounted volumes, and pairs seamlessly with reverse proxies or zero-trust networks.

## Key highlights
* Secure local users, groups, and optional OpenID Connect (OIDC) integrations keep sensitive files protected.
* Grid and list views adapt to every workflow, with fast previews for media, documents, and source code.
* Built-in uploads, move/copy helpers, favorites, and multi-select actions speed up repetitive tasks.
* Configurable themes, dark/light modes, and accessible keyboard shortcuts deliver a consistent experience on every device.
