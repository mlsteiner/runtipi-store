CrossWatch is a synchronization engine that keeps your Plex, Jellyfin, Emby, SIMKL, Trakt and MDBlist in sync. It runs locally with a clean web UI where you link accounts, define sync pairs, run them manually or on a schedule, and review stats and history. CrossWatch also includes its own tracker to keep your data safe with snapshots.
